Format

120 game Regular Season = All 30 MLB teams play a 120 game Regular Season.  Division teams are played 15 times (60 games), Non-Division teams are played 6 times (60 games).  If Regular season Interleague play is desired, adjust the season so Division teams played 12 times, Non-Division teams played 6 times, 12 games played Interleague.

30 game Pennant = In each League, the Top 6 regular season teams then play a 30 game Pennant for League Champion.  It's only fair to crown a League Champion if each team has played the other an equal number of times home and away.  The League Champion can be decided by the best record, or it could go to a best of Series up to 7 games.  The winner receives a Trophy as League Champion, and the best 2 teams (total 4 teams) get a bye to Round 3 of the World Series.

32 game World Series Preliminary = In each League, the Bottom 9 regular season teams then play a 32 game World Series Preliminary.  The best 4 teams (total 8 teams) across the 32 games receive a berth in the World Series.  The remaining 5 teams (total 10 teams) go home for the season having played at least 76 home games.

5 Round Interleague World Series
Round 1 = AL 1 vs NL 8, AL 2 vs NL 7 = The remaining 8 clubs (total 16) in each League (bottom 4 from Pennant, top 4 from World Series Preliminary) play Interleague Best of 3.  Format is 2 home, 1 away, but could be constructed however.
Round 2 = 8 teams remaining.  Best of 3.
Round 3 = 8 teams remaining.  Top 2 teams (total 4) from Pennant vs Remaining 4 teams.  Best of 3.
Round 4 = 4 teams remaining.  Best of 3.
Round 5 = Remaining 2 teams play a Best of Series for Tournament Champion.
